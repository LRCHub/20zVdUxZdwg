[00:17.09] She'd take the world off my shoulders if it was ever hard to move
[00:25.67] She'd turn the rain to a rainbow when I was living in the blue
[00:34.29] Why then, if she's so perfect, do I still wish that it was you?
[00:42.61] Perfect don't mean that it's working, so what can I do? (Ooh)
[00:50.20] When you're out of sight in my mind
[00:58.52] 'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us
[01:07.29] And I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was
[01:15.67] Said, "I'm fine" and said, "I moved on"
[01:19.32] I'm only here passing time in her arms
[01:23.54] Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us
[01:33.45] Tell me he savors your glory, does he laugh the way I did?
[01:41.87] Is this a part of your story? One that I had never lived
[01:50.40] Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
[01:53.65] And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
[01:58.90] Maybe you'll start slipping slowly and find me again
[02:06.64] When you're out of sight in my mind
[02:15.15] 'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us
[02:23.57] And I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was
[02:32.02] Said, "I'm fine" and said, "I moved on"
[02:35.84] I'm only here passing time in her arms
[02:40.12] Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us
[02:56.12] 
[03:01.62] 'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us
[03:10.22] And I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was
[03:18.55] Said, "I'm fine" and said, "I moved on"
[03:22.39] I'm only here passing time in her arms
[03:26.51] Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us
